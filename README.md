# hypothesis-testing
Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom.
I take the data from the file university-towns.txt to clean it and get the needed data to perform my t-test to check the hypothesis.
